# Variables

> Variables allows for more interactive and dynamic dashboards. Instead of
> hard-coding things like server, application and sensor name in your metric
> queries you can use variables in their place. Variables are shown as
> dropdown select boxes at the top of the dashboard. These dropdowns
> allow changing the data being displayed in your dashboard.
