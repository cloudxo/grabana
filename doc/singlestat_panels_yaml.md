# Singlestat panels

> The Singlestat Panel allows you to show the one main summary stat of a SINGLE
> series. It reduces the series into a single number (by looking at the max,
> min, average, or sum of values in the series). Singlestat also provides
> thresholds to color the stat or the Panel background. It can also translate
> the single number into a text value, and show a sparkline summary of the series.
